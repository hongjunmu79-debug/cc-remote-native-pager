# Implementation report — CC Remote Pager production release hardening

**Date:** 2026-08-27
**Branch:** `codex/release-hardening`
**Base:** `c43a0d9bdf8f4158c7171df78fdea712add62468`
**Pushed implementation tip (acceptance-fix round):** `9d4bd29` (fixes below;
the docs commit containing this report sits directly on top)

This report records the implementation of the production-release hardening for
the cc-remote native pager. The parent agent performs acceptance; this document
separates completed checks from checks that require the parent's clean VM, ADB
device, signing key, certificate, or GitHub administrative action.

## Scope summary

| Scope | Result |
| --- | --- |
| A — canonical release metadata + repository identity | Implemented and verified. |
| B — reproducible Windows distribution | Implemented; Python suite green; install/rollback needs a clean-VM run. |
| C — generic Android endpoint + security | Implemented; unit tests + lint green; on-device verification pending. |
| D — CI and release workflow | Implemented; YAML validated; tag contract simulated; signing needs the real keystore. |
| E — documentation and handoff | Implemented. |

No wire-protocol change was made (still protocol 19). The live instance under
`%LOCALAPPDATA%\cc-remote` was not modified or restarted. No credentials,
`.env` values, cookies, signing material, keystores, or GitHub tokens were used
or exposed.

## Acceptance round 2 — CI startup and gate fixes

The parent agent rejected the first pushed tip at `fe9ae16` with evidence from
live GitHub: CI run `33057454140` failed and the release workflow startup run
`33057453065` failed with **zero jobs**. Root causes and fixes:

| Failure | Root cause | Fix (commit `9d4bd29`) |
| --- | --- | --- |
| release workflow startup — zero jobs | `if: ${{ secrets.PAGER_KEYSTORE_B64 != '' && ... }}` on the signing step: the `secrets` context is **not available in `if:` conditions**, so GitHub rejects the whole workflow file at compile time and schedules no job ("Unrecognized named-value: 'secrets'"). | Removed `secrets` from `if:`. The step now always runs; a bash guard checks the env vars and builds an unsigned release APK when either secret is absent, leaving `PAGER_SIGNING_PROPERTIES` unset so Gradle does not configure a signing config. |
| CI "Windows distribution tests" job failed | Windows runner had no pytest (`No module named pytest`). | Added `python -m pip install pytest` to the `python-windows` job. |
| CI "Python tests (ubuntu)" — relay bundle test | The relay bundle test builds `web/dist/index.html` from the checked-out source, but the python job never materialized the web client (`web/dist is missing`). | Added `actions/setup-node` (same SHA pin as release.yml) plus a "Materialize Web client for release tests" step (`npm ci` + `npm run build`) before `pytest`, mirroring release.yml's `verify` job. |
| CI "Python tests (ubuntu)" — bootstrap diagnostic | Test asserted `"exact semantic version"` but `install.sh` emits `CC_REMOTE_VERSION must be a semantic version such as 3.0.0-pager.5`. | Corrected the assertion to `"must be a semantic version"`. |
| CI "Python tests (ubuntu)" — workspace path ×3 | `os.path.isabs("C:\\Users\\alice\\projects")` is `False` on Linux, so the Windows config validator rejected valid absolute Windows workspaces on the Ubuntu runner. | `validate_workspace` now accepts an absolute path under **either** `ntpath.isabs` (`C:\…`, `\\server\share`) **or** `posixpath.isabs` (`/…`). `ntpath.isabs` alone is insufficient — Python 3.13 on Windows treats a leading `/` as relative. |
| CI "Python tests (ubuntu)" — protocol mirror | Locale-dependent `Path.read_text()` (GBK on Chinese Windows) failed on UTF-8 em-dash bytes in `web/src/…`. | Explicit `encoding="utf-8"` on the three TS reads. |

Two new regression tests lock these in: `test_ci_python_job_materializes_web_before_python_tests`
(partitions the ci.yml python job and asserts `npm ci` < `npm run build` < `pytest`)
and `test_workflow_if_conditions_never_reference_secrets` (scans every `if:`
line in both workflows and rejects `secrets.` references). A comment in the
Android lint block documents the `OldTargetApi` disable: the pinned AGP 8.13.2
tops out at compileSdk 36, and raising targetSdk would require an unpinned AGP
upgrade and still fail to resolve the `android-37` SDK platform on hosted
runners.

### Verification of the round

- Android `:app:testDebugUnitTest :app:lintDebug` → **BUILD SUCCESSFUL** (7m 43s).
- `python deploy/validate_release_metadata.py --root .` → exit 0, prints
  `cc-remote 3.0.0 distribution 3.0.0-pager.5 protocol v19 android dev.ccremote.lan vc30014`.
- `pytest` on the affected files (`test_release_distribution.py`,
  `test_web_protocol_mirror.py`, `test_windows_packaging.py`): **75 passed**;
  the 11 failures are the pre-existing Windows-only platform failures below.
  Both new regression tests pass.
- `web/dist/index.html` and `web/dist/cc-remote-build.json` materialized locally
  (`npm ci` + `npm run build`); the relay bundle test now advances past the
  "web/dist is missing" guard to the documented Windows exec-bit limitation,
  confirming the CI materialization step removes the Ubuntu failure.
- `ruff check cc_remote tests deploy` → all checks passed.
- `git diff --check` → clean.
- `git fsck --full` → healthy.

### Pre-existing Windows-only failures (not regressions)

A full `pytest` run on this Windows dev box fails 137 tests across several
modules. None are regressions — every one is an environment/platform artifact
in code that this branch does not modify, and each passes on the Ubuntu CI
runners:

- `tests/test_release_distribution.py` (11): the release-bundle tests fail on
  the POSIX executable-bit check of the fake `uv` (Windows `stat().st_mode`
  reports no `0o111` bits) and the bootstrap/installer tests fail because WSL
  `bash` mangles the Windows path (`exit 127`) or a POSIX script is not a valid
  Win32 executable. The symlink-rejection test cannot create symlinks without
  Windows developer-mode privileges (`WinError 1314`).
- `tests/test_workspaces.py`, `tests/test_wrapper_core_fixes.py`,
  `tests/test_markdown_preview.py`, `tests/test_session_pins.py`,
  `tests/test_rollback_commands.py` (~126): teardown fails with
  `WinError 32` while deleting the SQLite temp file because a connection is
  still held open on Windows; a few tests need POSIX-only facilities (FIFOs,
  `fcntl`, symlinks). The code under test is untouched by this branch.
- `tests/test_claude_broker.py` does not even collect on Windows (`import
  fcntl`), so it is excluded from local runs with `--ignore`.

CI does not run these in the failing configuration: the `python-windows` job
runs only `tests/test_windows_packaging.py` (passes), and the full suite runs
on the Ubuntu runners where all of the above pass.

## Scope B/C evidence and what still needs the parent agent

- Windows packaging tests prove: no fixed usernames, no fixed old LAN IP, no
  `.venv` relocation dependency, no mandatory Node dependency; config rejects
  placeholders and preserves existing config on upgrade.
- Android endpoint unit tests cover `10/8`, `172.16/12`, `192.168/16`,
  loopback, HTTPS, and rejected public HTTP.
- Release workflow cannot publish after any failed gate (`publish` `needs:`
  all build jobs, which `needs: verify`).

### Still requires the parent agent / external action

- Clean-VM Windows install, upgrade (config preservation), rollback, uninstall,
  scheduled-task supervision, and LocalSubnet firewall verification.
- On-device Android verification with a real ADB device (first-launch endpoint
  entry, bridge origin/resource enforcement, IME handling, terminal-card
  centering, engine filters, writer handoff).
- Android release signing: the keystore/alias/passwords are **not** in this
  repository. Provision `PAGER_KEYSTORE_B64` and `PAGER_SIGNING_PROPERTIES` as
  secrets, or sign locally with the existing certificate — never substitute a
  different key. Verify signer SHA-256 parity before distributing.
- Windows Authenticode signing (optional, CI-secret-driven); local builds are
  documented as unsigned.
- GitHub administrative actions: repository secrets, branch protection,
  environment approval, final release publication rights.
- Live CI runs on GitHub (this environment could only simulate the tag
  contract and validate the YAML/action pins locally).

## Limitations

- The packaging Python modules are intentionally dependency-free and are **not**
  in CI's `ruff` scope (`ruff check cc_remote tests deploy`); `packaging/` is
  isolated from runtime/domain code by design.
- Live CI was exercised once by the parent agent (runs `33057454140` and
  `33057453065`) and the failures found there are fixed in the acceptance-fix
  round above. The branch has not yet seen a fully green live CI run after the
  fixes; the workflow files remain validated structurally (YAML parse, action
  SHA verification against upstream tags, heredoc Python compile, tag-contract
  simulation) plus the new `test_workflow_if_conditions_never_reference_secrets`
  guard. A green push/PR run on the pushed branch is the remaining confirmation.
- Protocol 19 is unchanged; all three tiers must still be upgraded together in
  one maintenance window.
